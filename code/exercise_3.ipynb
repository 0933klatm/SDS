    "One longstanding debate in the study of international relations\n",
    "concerns the question of whether individual political leaders can make a difference.  Some emphasize that leaders with different ideologies and personalities can significantly affect the course of a nation. Others argue that political leaders are severely constrained by historical and institutional forces.  Did individuals like Hitler, Mao, Roosevelt, and Churchill make a big difference?  The difficulty of empirically testing these arguments stems from the fact that the change of leadership is not random and there are many confounding factors to be adjusted for.\n",
