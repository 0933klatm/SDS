\LARGE Git & Github

## Why version control?

> Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you don't reply to emails.

Detailed log of all changes.

Easy to revert back to previous versions.

Clear attribution of work (who contributed what).

## git & github

**what is `git`**?
Git is an open source command line program for version control.

**what is `github`**? 
A company/web service that hosts Git repositories and enables 'social coding'

**What is GitHub for Mac/Windows?**
A GUI for Git.

Makes it easier to use.

Ultimately just does command line Git.

## Getting started with Git

Key terms (local):

- Repository (repo): a directory where Git looks for changes

- Initialize (init): have Git begin watching a directory

- add: stage a file so that Git starts watching it

- master: the main branch. By convention this should be the most stable version.

- push: commit changes to a remotely hosted repository

- pull: merge changes from a remotely hosted repository

In GUI GitHub push and pull are combined into sync

\LARGE markdown & rmarkdown

## Why use Markdown?

Easy to learn and use.

Focus on __content__, rather than __coding__ and debugging __errors__.

It's flexible. Markdown was created to simplify HTML, but with the right tools, your Markdown files can easily be converted to many different formats!

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a particular type of markup language.

Markup languages are designed produce documents from plain text.

Some of you may be familiar with _LaTeX_. This is another (less human friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

_LaTeX_ gives you much greater control, but it is restricted to pdf and has a __much__ greater learning curve.

markdown was created for the web (you know it if you use Github, Stackoverflow, etc.)

## Example

Suppose we want to create a nested list

* fruits
    - apples
        - macintosh
    - pears 
    - peaches
* vegetables
    - chard
    
## Latex

```latex
\begin{itemize}      
\item fruits         
\begin{itemize}       
\item apples          
  \begin{itemize}     
  \item macintosh     
  \end{itemize}       
\item pears 
\item peaches         
\end{itemize}         
\item vegetables        
  \begin{itemize}       
    \item chard           
  \end{itemize}         
\end{itemize}  
```    
    
## HTML

```html
    <ul>
        <li>fruits
        <ul>
            <li>apples
            <ul>
                <li>macintosh</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>pears</li>
            <li>peaches</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>vegetables
        <ul>
            <li>brocolli</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>    
```

## What is `rmarkdown`?

`rmarkdown` is a new package from RStudio that merges a lot of technologies in an exciting way.

In fact, in RStudio now, you integrate R code into your Markdown document and render as HTML/pdf/Word in the click of a button!
