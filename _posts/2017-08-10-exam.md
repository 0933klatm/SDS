The exam in Social Data Science is a 7-day written assignment done in groups of 4. All members of the group should hand in the assignment individually before the deadline.

**What we expect**

> For the exam students are expected to pose an interesting social science question and attempt to answer it using standard academic practices including original data collection and statistical analysis.

When grading the assignments we will consider how well you apply the tools you learn in the course. Therefore, we will emphasize

- Posing an interesting question
- *Answering* your interesting question
- Generating new data
- Clear presentation of results
- Using and explaining relevant statistical techniques

**Details**

- You will work in **randomly assigned** groups of 4
- The exam project has to be **8-12 normal pages** in total (as defined by the Department of Economics, the same as for a BA/MA thesis, Econometrics B, etc)
- The project has to be handed in no later than **August 26** to the course page in Absalon.   
  - The project paper should be uploaded in `pdf` format. The filename should be your real name separated by underscore.
  - You also need to upload your code as a separate `Jupyter Notebook` file or `Python` script. The filename should again be your name but the extension should be `.ipynb` or `.py`.
