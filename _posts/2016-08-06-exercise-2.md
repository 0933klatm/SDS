You will work with data from [www.ipaidabribe.com](http://www.ipaidabribe.com/). This is a crowdsourced attempt to measure corruption in India. The idea is simple: Every time you pay a bribe, you upload the amount, details of the transaction, and location. This data thus provides an alternative to official government statistics of corruption.

According to their website

> I Paid a Bribe is a site that focuses on crowdsourced reports of corruption and bribery from India and all over the world.  
The site lays emphasis on the various kinds of Retail Corruption. This is kind of corruption that confronts ordinary citizens in their daily lives when they're not able to avail of services they are legitimately entitled to from the government â€“ getting a driver's license, a birth certificate, registering a purchase of property.

The most recent reports are located [here](http://www.ipaidabribe.com/reports/paid).

I want you to **scrape the latest 200 reports** from the website. The data has to include

- title
- amount
- name of department
- transaction detail
- number of views
- city

In addition, I want you to add a date variable to the data frame.

Afterwards, I want you to do a data analysis on the data. What do you think is interesting about these data? Have you discovered anything about corruption in India by looking at these data?
