Dear all,
There has been a slight change of plans. Classification and Unsupervised Learning is moved to wednesday, and we will start the module Text as Data tuesday.

Make sure you have the following packages installed before Tuesday Text as Data:
* NLTK
  * `pip install nltk` or `conda install -c anaconda nltk`
* Gensim
  * `pip install gensim`
    
The focus of the two modules will be extracting reliable information from text data with the use of machine learning. This means that we are gonna practice our machine learning skills - both supervised learning and unsupervised for feature engineering - using text data. 

See you there,
Snorre
