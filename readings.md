Course readings are provided below. We do not expect you to read entries marked as "inspiration". They are provided in case you have spare time and want to dig deeper into the topics. Kosuke Imai's book is forthcoming at Princeton University Press. Professor Imai has kindly given us permission to use the textbook free of charge in advance of its official release. A PDF of the book is available through Absalon. Please do not circulate it.

### August 8
*Keywords:* Introduction to SDS, Introduction to R.

**Required**

- [Preparing for Social Data Science](https://sebastianbarfort.github.io/sds_summer/posts/2016/08/01/preparing-for-sds.html)
- [The Scientist: Get With the Program](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43632/title/Get-With-the-Program/)
- Imai, Kosuke. 2016. *A First Course in Quantitative Social Science*. Read chapter 1.

**Inspiration**

If you’re interested, and want to delve deeper into coding and programming (you certainly don’t have to, they are not required for this course), I highly recommend the following
posts

- [New York Times: Data Analysts Captivated by R’s Power](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?pagewanted=all)
- [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/?cmpid=twtr1)
- [Programming Sucks](http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks)

### August 9 & 10
*Keywords:* Visualization, Data Manipulation, Data Import, Functions.

**Required**

- Grolemund, Garrett and Hadley Wickham. 2016. "[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)". Read chapters 3, 4 and 9. Browse chapter 15.

- Imai, Kosuke. 2016. *A First Course in Quantitative Social Science*. Read chapter 4.1-4.3.[^rnote]

[^rnote]: You will notice that Kosuke Imai uses the base `R` package much more frequently than we do. We will instead write `R` code that follows the "tidyverse" approach to data analysis. We do not expect you to repeat every line of code in the chapter, but you should have a rough idea of what each line of code does.
